    """
    A class for constructing and evaluating equation parse trees. E.g. (x+2)=(y+3)

    The EquationParseTree class supports building a binary tree from a mathematical equation,
    evaluating that expression, and handling variable assignments and references within expressions.
    It uses a hashtable for memoization to optimize repeated evaluations and to handle 
    circular dependencies inherited from ParseTree.

    Attributes:
        equations (Hashtable): Stores variable assignments and their corresponding expression trees.
        memoization_cache (Hashtable): Cache used to store previously computed results for optimization.
        active_evaluations (set): Tracks variables currently being evaluated to detect circular dependencies.

    """
    OOP Principles applied:

    Encapsulation:
    The EquationParseTree class encapsulates its internal state using private attributes (__equations, __memoization_cache, __active_evaluations) 
    and provides getter and setter methods to control access to these attributes. This protects the integrity of the class data 
    and prevents direct modification from outside the class.

    Abstraction:
    The EquationParseTree class abstracts the complexity of constructing, evaluating, and rearranging equation parse trees. 
    It provides high-level methods (e.g., build_parse_tree, evaluate_equation, add_statement, rearrange_tree) that hide 
    the implementation details of these operations, allowing users to interact with the class interface without needing 
    to understand its internal workings.

    Polymorphism:
    The EquationParseTree class demonstrates polymorphism through method overloading and method overriding. 
    For example, the __evaluate_equation method is overridden from the ParseTree class to handle equation-specific evaluation, 
    while the build_parse_tree method overloads the same method in the ParseTree class to accommodate equation parsing rules. 
    This allows for different behavior depending on the context in which the methods are called.

    Modularity:
    The EquationParseTree class is modular, with each method responsible for a specific aspect of equation parsing and evaluation. 
    This modular design promotes code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility by allowing individual components 
    to be modified or replaced without affecting the overall functionality of the class.
